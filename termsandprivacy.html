<p class='help'><b>Terms and Conditions</b><br>
By registering to use this site you agree to the following conditions:</p>
<ul class='help'>
<li>Do not create repetitive identical commands.</li>
<li>Do not write content that you think others may find offensive. This applies to command titles, descriptions, tags and comments. The exception to this rule is with private commands. You can do what you like with these.</li> 
<li>If you find an exploit or bug, please report it via the reporting system or to bimbimma@gmail.com</li>
<li>Commands that have not been viewed in over a year may be deleted. This is to maximise database storage. Commands that are viewed at least once every 365 days will remain.</li> 
<li>The administrator (me) may disable user accounts and delete commands and associated data in situations where MCStacker has been misused.</li>  
<li>There is the potential for commands generated by MCStacker to break your maps if values have been entered outside the expected ranges or are in an invalid format. I take no responsibility for commands that break your maps. Use commands generated by MCStacker at your own risk.</li>
</ul>
<p class='help'><b>Privacy Statement</b><br>
I take extreme care with your private information. I will not be disclosing any of your personal information to any other party. Although this website does not use SSL, passwords are hashed and salted before being sent to the server. Before passwords are stored in the database they are hashed again with a more robust hashing scheme. Even I wonâ€™t know your password. If you have concerns about password security, best practice is to use a password that is unique to MCStacker and different to what you use to login into your email and Minecraft. Your email is used only for account verification, password resetting and to contact you if there is something important to discuss about your usage of MCStacker. At this stage I do not plan on sending bulk emails to registered users. But if I do, an opt-out will be provided to prevent receiving future emails. </p>
