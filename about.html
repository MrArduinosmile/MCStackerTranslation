<b>Summon</b><br>The summon command generator enables you to stack mobs on top of each other. You can equip mobs with up to five items and adjust the drop chances for each item of equipment. Most of the options that are specific to each of the entities are available. Mobs can have multiple Status Effects(potion) applied to them also. Motion settings can be applied and copied to other entities in the stack.
</p>
<p>
<b>Spawner</b><br>Instead of summoning a mob, you can set a spawner block to spawn the entities for you. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Give</b><br>Generate give commands to give players items. The give generator utilizes a fully featured target selector.
</p>
<p>
<b>Replace Item (entity|block)</b><br>The replaceitem command enables you to modify the slots and inventory of players, mobs and container blocks.
</p>
<p>
<b>Set Block, Fill, &amp; Block Data</b><br>Most Tile IDs are available and NBT tags are well supported. This includes container blocks, player heads, SpawnPotentials and more. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Items</b><br>Items have most of the options you will need. This includes enchantments, name, lore, custom potions effects(for potions), colors (for leather armor). Can Place On, Can Destroy, Hide Flags, explosions (for fireworks), player heads, written books and more. All items can also have attribute modifiers applied to them.

The commands that are generated can be very long so they will not work if you are pasting them directly into the chat bar in Minecraft. To use the commands generated from this tool, you will need to use <a href='http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Command_block' target='_blank'>Command Blocks</a>. To use command blocks make sure you are an op if using a server or if in single player mode have cheats enabled. To give yourself a command block, type in <b>/give @p minecraft:command_block</b> . You will need to be in creative mode to paste commands into a command block.  Finally activate the Command block with a redstone torch, pressure plate, switch etc.
</p>

Be careful using this generator. There is always the potential to break your maps if you use values that are outside the expected ranges or are in an invalid format. To be safe try out your commands on a throwaway map or make sure you have your maps backed up. This tool does not check your values for validity. Enjoy.
