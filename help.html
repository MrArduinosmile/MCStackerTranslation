<h2 class='help'>Help</h2>
<p class='help'>MCStacker now enables you to save, share and discuss your commands with others. You can also search or browse commands created by others.  To use these new features you will need to register an account.</p>

<h2 class='help'>Creating an account</h2>
<p class='help'>To create an account you will need to click the 'Register a new account'  button. You will need to provide a user name, password and valid email address. Emails will need to be verified before your account can be accessed. Once your account is activated, you may sign in.</p>  

<h2 class='help'>Save your commands</h2>
<p class='help'>After you have filled out all of the options in any of the command generators, you can save it by clicking the 'Save As New Command' button. You will then be able to write some information about the command and set some of the options. You can save somebody else's command as a new command. Saving a command this way does not create a derivative relationship. More about that later.</p>  

<h3 class='help'>Title</h3> 
<p class='help'>Give your command an appropriate title. It should concisely indicate what the command is or does. This also helps others to find your command via search.</p>  

<h3 class='help'>Description</h3>
<p class='help'>Provide a detailed description about what the command is or does. Markdown syntax is provided here so that you can bold, underline, italicise text and also provide links. Links can be to anything related to the command such as a You Tube video or to a social network profile of the commands creator. It may not be used for linking to pages that is off-topic or inappropriate in any way.</p>  

<h3 class='help'>Public</h3>
<p class='help'>Maybe you want to save commands for your use only. If you untick the public checkbox, Others will not be able to see your command. It will not come up in search and can not be accessed via the share link.</p>  

<h3 class='help'>Allowing comments</h3>
<p class='help'>If your command is public you may also allow comments. Other registered users can comment on and discuss your command. Once a command has some comments, you can disallow new comments by unticking 'allow comments'. This effectively locks the comment thread, so that other users will still be able to see the previous comments. As the creator of the command you get to delete comments made by other users. Look for the trash can icon next to comments to delete them. This should only be done where the comment is inappropriate and if the deletion of the comment does not leave gaps in the conversation. You can delete all comments at once. This should only be done when circumstances require it. Some users could get annoyed if they've taken the time to leave a comment only to have it deleted. So use this feature sparingly.</p>   

<h3 class='help'>Tags</h3>
<p class='help'>Tags enable others to find your commands via search. You can enter up to 10 tags per command.</p>   


<h2 class='help'>Search/Browse</h2>
<p class='help'>There many ways to search for a command. You can search by command type, title, description, creator, tags and comments. 10 Search results are displayed per page with a maximum of 40 pages and results can be sorted by the column headings. Search result page numbers are available along the bottom of the search results. You can browse all results by leaving the search text blank. Advanced boolean search strings are accepted. Advanced boolean search strings are accepted. A leading plus (+) sign indicates that this word must be present in every result returned. A leading minus (-) sign indicates that this word must not be present in any result returned. ( ) Parentheses are used to group words into sub expressions. A phrase that is enclosed in double quotes matches only results that contain this phrase literally.</p>  

<h2 class='help'>Liking</h2>
<p class='help'>As you view commands created by others, you may find something you like. Just click the Like button. This serves two purposes. The command appears in your Likes list so that you can find it again quickly. And it increases the Like score of the command so that others may find it when sorting search results by the Like score. The most liked commands will rise to the top.</p>  

<h2 class='help'>Cloning Commands and Derivatives</h2>
<p class='help'>When viewing a command (your own or another's), you may clone it. This saves a copy of it to your account and also creates a derivative relationship. The purpose of the derivative system is to provide credit to original creators of interesting, useful or complicated commands. The title and description is copied but associated tags, comments and likes are not cloned. From here you can make changes to the command and save it. A cloned command links back to it's source(parent). The derivative relationship can be deleted in two ways. You can delete the relationship the command has to it's source. And you can delete the relationship this command has with any newer commands that were derived from it (children). You would delete the derivative relationship when the command has been significantly modified so much that the derivative relationship is no longer relevant. Only creators of the command can delete derivative relationships. </p>      

<h2 class='help'>Commenting</h2>
<p class='help'>If a command is allowing comments, you may leave one. You may also delete any comments that are your own. Markdown syntax is also allowed and links to related content can be posted into comments. Please keep comments relevant to the command. 

<h2 class='help'>Discuss</h2>
<p class='help'>
The Discuss area displays a list of commands you are following that have unread comments. By definition commands you follow are the ones you've created, liked or have commented on. Commands are removed from the discuss list when you've read the comments for the command. This feature facilitates discussions on commands you have shown an interest in and saves you from clicking into many commands looking for new comments.

<h2 class='help'>Reporting</h2>
<p class='help'>Sometimes you might find a command that has something wrong with it. Perhaps it is buggy, problematic, or offensive. You can report it and I will look at it to see what needs to be done.</p>
