<p><b>The MCStacker Block Commands Update</b><br>
This update provides command generators for the fill, setblock, replaceitem block and blockdata commands. DataTag code can be generated for most of the complex blocks including chests, command blocks, signs, skulls, mob spawners (with Spawn Potentials) and more. If I have have left anything important out, please let me know.</p><p>Another feature of this update is the 'Any Command' type. This is where you can manually craft a command and save it. Commands here can be set to private for your own use. If it's an interesting command set it to public for others to see and discuss. This command type can be used to seek help if you have a broken command you need help with.

Have fun making them awesome loot chests.

<p><b>The MCStacker Community Update</b><br>
MCStacker started in February 2014 as a simple tool that enabled you to stack mobs on each other. At the time there did not seem to be any on-line generators that could do this. So I made one. At the start MCStacker had limited options for the specific entities. It probably would have stayed that way if nobody took the time to email me to request new features.
</p><p> 
Throughout the middle of 2014 MCStacker started to gain popularity. Interest in this tool began to build and I was noticing it getting mentioned frequently on forums and other places on the web. Feature requests and bug reports continued. More features were added. In mid 2014 I considered what MCStacker could become. I began imagining a system where users could save their commands for later use or to share them with others. Within the Summon Generator alone, there are so many complex entities that can be created. My goal was to make MCStacker the go to place to find complicated entity stacks for map makers or for people who just want experiment with the possibilities of the summon command. But I did not stop there. Why not turn MCStacker into a forum where users could create commands and discuss them.
</p><p>
This version of MCStacker now facilitates the Saving, Sharing, Liking, Searching and Discussion of commands. The interest this tool now receives has justified the work I've had to do to create this version. It has been good learning some new technologies and utilising some programming and database knowledge that I have not used in a while. 
</p><p>
There is still work to be done and so long as Minecraft keeps evolving so too will MCStacker. I plan on adding improvements and am always open to feature requests. Please keep the bug reports coming if you find an issue.
<p><b>Contact</b><br>
Please email me at <a href="mailto:bimbimma@gmail.com">bimbimma@gmail.com</a> for feedback, suggestions, bug reports or whatever. If submitting bugs, it helps me a lot if you can be really specific about the problem you are having. If MCStacker is outputting broken summon commands, please send it to me so I can get it sorted out. Alternatively, you can use the 'Report' system on saved commands.
</p>
<p><b>The Future</b><br>
Thanks to all of the people who have contacted me to say thanks and to request new features. MCStacker will only ever support vanilla (unmodded) Minecraft. Some people have asked for generators for plugins and mods. I am unable to support these due to time constraints. 
</p><p>
I am now working on modifying the site so that labels and tooltips can be translated into other languages more easily. Once this is complete I will look forward to hearing from volunteers who might like to translate MCStacker into other languages.
